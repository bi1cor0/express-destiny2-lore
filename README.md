# The Destiny 2 Original Character Submitter
My original vision for this app was to have users go ahead and submit their original characters that they played as in Destiny 2. The game allows players for character creation. But there is a severe lack of character backstories or even personalities tied to the guardians. I've also added pathways for exotic weapons and npc data. 

## Future Plans
To be honest Express was the portion of the lesson I got stuck on and struggled with, since these are new lessons and concepts to me to learn. So I mainly did this project as I was learning and catching up on the lessons. I wanted for this app to display the current entries from the data files on the webpage, but due to the current time frame of the assignment, I was only able to get to the path routes of CRUD methods. Meaning I managed to learn make paths for GET, POST, UPDATE and DELETE. The query parameters portion of the assignment I wasn't able to get to, since that required some logic that I wasn't able to figure out in time for this project's deadline. But I hope to revisit this project to properly create all the features I want to put here. Such as editing npc data and getting exotic weapon data through a user interface.
